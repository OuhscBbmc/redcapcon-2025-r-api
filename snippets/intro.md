Simple Introduction
===========

One has a choice of `REDCapR` or `redcapAPI` and both offer a rich set of features. The `REDCapR` package has better `tibble` integration with the more modern `tidyverse` style of operations. The `redcapAPI` package is targeted towards base R and includes additional support for automated environments. This introduction will cover examples using both libraries. 

We begin with loading libraries and a token and a uri. NOTE: writing a token in R code is poor security practice. More on proper security in the next section.

```{r}
uri      <- "https://redcap-dev-2.ouhsc.edu/redcap/api/"
token    <- "9A068C425B1341D69E83064A2D273A70" 
```

## Read Data (Unstructured)

### REDCapR

```{r}
rcr_1 <- REDCapR::redcap_read(redcap_uri=uri, token=token)
#> 24 variable metadata records were read from REDCap in 0.3 seconds.  The http status code was 200.
#> The data dictionary describing 17 fields was read from REDCap in 0.2 seconds.  The http status code was 200.
#> 3 instrument metadata records were read from REDCap in 0.1 seconds.  The http status code was 200.
#> 1 rows were read from REDCap in 0.1 seconds.  The http status code was 200.
#> 2 data access groups were read from REDCap in 0.1 seconds.  The http status code was 200.
#> 5 records and 1 columns were read from REDCap in 0.5 seconds.  The http status code was 200.
#> Starting to read 5 records  at 2025-09-09 18:08:59.403296.
#> Reading batch 1 of 1, with subjects 1 through 5 (ie, 5 unique subject records).
#> 5 records and 25 columns were read from REDCap in 0.3 seconds.  The http status code was 200.
#>
rcr_1 <- rcr_1$data # Extract just the data
```

At this point, the data.frame `rcr_1` has everything one needs to start analyzing the project.

### redcapAPI

`redcapAPI` has a different approach in that a connection object is created. This object maintains state locally for things like the data dictionary to minimize round trips to the server.

```{r}
conn <- redcapAPI::redcapConnection(uri, token)
rca_1 <- exportRecordsTyped(conn)
```

```{r}
head(rca_1)

Note at this point there are already differences in the data, but not the fitted model parameters. The variable for sex in the REDCapR is presented as the numeric code, whereas the redcapAPI version converted it to a factor utilizing the defined metadata. How these choices of data type conversion are made and options for specifying them are covered later.

Both libraries have advantages and disadvantages when compared. The biggest consideration at this point is a user writing code to analyze data must chose a path as the downstream code working on the data is not compatible and cannot be easily swapped out. What support does one have with their department and what code are is shared for analysis is a strong consideration.  

*Pause for questions.*

## Be Nice to Your Server

When you read a dataset for the first time, you probably havenât decided which columns are needed so it makes sense to retrieve everything. As you gain familiarity with the data and with the analytic objectives, consider being more selective with the variables and rows transported from the remote server to your local machine.

Advantages include:

1. A server is almost always more efficient filtering than a language like R or Python.
1. REDCapâs PHP code retrieves less data from REDCapâs database and translates less to a text format (like csv or json).
1. Fewer bytes are transmitted across your network.
1. Your local machine will have better performance, because R has a smaller dataset to manage.
1. Your brain doesnât have to look past unnecessary columns.
1. Your R code doesnât have filter what the server already removed.
1. Highly-sensitive PHI columns that are unnecessary for an analysis remain on the server.

### Specify Rows and Columns

As a basic demo of both libraries capacity to limit a query, let's make our query only pull records 1 and 4, and only the fields (columns): 'record_id', 'name_first', and 'age'. 

```r
records <- c(1, 4)
fields  <- c("record_id", "name_first", "age")
REDCapR::redcap_read(
  redcap_uri  = uri,
  token       = token,
  fields      = fields,
  records     = records,
  verbose     = FALSE
)$data
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã 3
#>   record_id name_first   age
#>       <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>
#> 1         1 Nutmeg        11
#> 2         4 Trudy         61
```

```r
exportRecordsTyped(
  conn,
  fields  = fields,
  records = records)
#>  record_id name_first age
#> 1         1     Nutmeg  11
#> 2         4      Trudy  61
```

#### Row Filtering

REDCapR offers a useful filter command. It limit rows via an expression before returning. See your server's documentation for the syntax rules of the filter statements. Remember to enclose your variable names in square brackets. Also be aware of differences between strings and numbers.

```r
REDCapR::redcap_read(
  redcap_uri    = uri,
  token         = token,
  filter_logic  = "'2003-01-01' < [dob]",
  verbose       = FALSE,
  fields        = fields
)$data
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã 3
#>   record_id name_first   age
#>       <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>
#> 1         1 Nutmeg        11
#> 2         2 Tumtum        11
```

Similar limitations of a query exist for `events` and `forms`.
